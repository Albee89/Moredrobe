Theme Bootstrapped from create-react-app and 1995 "Clueless" Cher's Wardrobe by Juliana Praxedes before adding on my own chnages- inspired by 90's fashion and cute, retro convenience, this app is is being built as a one-stop reuse/recycle/thrift stop shop! You can visit your own closet to try on uploaded clothes. Other components including a virtual Vintage Store, full try- on wardrobe and Sip and Swap party still in development.
